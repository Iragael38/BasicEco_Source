<h2>2 questions on the “Exercise 2 : Cobb-Douglas Production Function” :</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>i don’t get the answer the question 3 in this exercise when the power of <span class="math inline">\(x^0.5\)</span> is changed to <span class="math inline">\(x−0.5\)</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The output elasticity with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> is defined as a ratio of marginal product and average product.
We can write marg.product as: <span class="math display">\[mP_{x_2} = \frac{\bar{x}_1^{0.3}}{2x_2^{0.5}}  = \bar{x}_1^{0.3} \times 0.5 \times x_2^{-0.5}\]</span></li>

<li>i don’t get the answer of the question number 1 The <span class="math inline">\(MPx_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ApX_2\)</span> , can you give me the steps on how you get this answer .</li>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Assuming input <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is fixed (<span class="math inline">\(x_1=10\)</span>), how will vary <em>Total Productivity</em>, <em>Average</em> and <em>Marginal Productivity</em> of input <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>?</p>
</div>
<div id="answer" class="section level3">
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Keeping constant the first input <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> to a level of 10 (that we can note <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = \bar{x}_1=10\)</span>.), we study the productivity of the second input <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Product when <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is fixed is obtained substituting <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1\)</span> in the production function.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q(\bar{x}_1, x_2)= \bar{x}_1^{0.3} x_2^{0.5}\]</span>
- Wich is a function of <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>. It gives the output quantities the firm can achieve with <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1\)</span> for varying <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>.
- Total product is increasing and concave with <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marginal product of input <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> is the supplementary output associated to a supplementary unit of input. It is measured by the ffirst derivative of the TP with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[mP_{x_2} = \frac{\partial Q(\bar{x}_1, x_2)}{\partial x_2}=\frac{\partial\bar{x}_1^{0.3} x_2^{0.5}}{\partial x_2} = \frac{\bar{x}_1^{0.3}}{2x_2^{0.5}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(mP_{x_2}\)</span> is decreasing and convex with <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>: productivity of <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> is non negative, increasing at a decreasing rate: diminishing returns of the input.</p></li>
<li><p>Average product of <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> is the average number of output per unit of input:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[AP{x_2} = \frac{Q(\bar{x}_1, x_2)}{x_2}=\frac{\bar{x}_1^{0.3}}{x_2^{0.5}}\]</span>
- <span class="math inline">\(AP_{x_2}\)</span> is decreasing and convex with <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span></p>

<h2>Question about the way to study the final exam for this class for a student who is studying economics for the first time.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is studying the lecture is enough with the exercices or should i make something extra?
<ul>
<li><em>For the Part One of Basic Economics</em>: Yes, study textbook chapters and case studies notion and discussion.</li>
<li>You can also take a look at the past exams on <a href="https://moodle.caseine.org/mod/folder/view.php?id=18140">Caseine</a> where some solutions or partial corrections are available.
<ul>
<li>you will find the type of questions that will fall.</li>
<li>In the 2020 version of the exam definition questions, short answers questions will be tranformed in a MCQ type.</li>
